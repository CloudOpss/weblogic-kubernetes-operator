# This script sets up a working directory for this sample. It copies ./env.sh
# to this directory. It fails with a non-zero exit code if it cannot
# create the directory when the directory doesn't already exist. It also fails
# if it cannot copy env.sh to the directory if env.sh isn't already copied to
# the directory.
#
# Once the working directory is setup, the other sample scripts will
# use this directory for their files. To customize sample variables,
# export the variables and/or modify WORKDIR/env.sh prior to running
# other scripts from this sample.
#
# Optional environment variable used by this script:
#
#    WORKDIR 
#      Working directory for the sample with at least 10g of space
#      defaults to /tmp/$USER/model-in-image-sample-work-dir
