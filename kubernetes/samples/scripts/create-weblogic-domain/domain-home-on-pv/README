This sample has been modified to create a domain on pv and also to update the domain using the new WDT model.

Use case - WDT can be used to discover an domain (could eb aon-prem). Running wdt discover
domain script generates a property file and a model file. The customer could then update the 
input yaml file for operator specific inputs. 

An updateDomain.sh script has been added to the sample to update a domain as well as the domain resource if needed.

This sample can take both the input yaml file and the generated properties file as inputs to 
createDomain.sh and updateDomain as a comma separated list.

Kuberentes section is added to the generated model file by the scripts and so both the create and update script 
uses wdt to extract the domain and create domain.yaml

To create a domain using this sample -

   1. copy the generated model file to wdt directory and rename it wdt_model_dynamic.yaml for dynamic clusters
   2. ./create-domain.sh -i create-domain-inputs.yaml,xxxxx.properties -o outputdir -v 
         The above command will create a domain on pv and also a domain.yaml file in outputdir/weblogic-domain/domainname
         The order of the input files does not matter.
   3. Check the domain.yaml to make sure there is no FIX ME. If there are any FIX ME's it has to be fixed before proceeding 
         to the next step.
   4. kubectl apply -f domain.yaml

To update a domain using this sample -

   1. Shut the domain down -
        vi domain.yaml (this domain.yml was generated by the previous step 4 above)
           and change the serverStartPolicy to NEVER and kubectl apply -f domain.yaml. All the server pods should be terminated.
        or edit the domain resource to change the serverStartPolicy to NEVER. Ther server pods will be terminated.
   2. update the original model file with what is needed to be added and rename it wdt_model_dynamic.yaml for dynamic clusters
   2. ./update-domain.sh -i create-domain-inputs.yaml,xxxxx.properties -o outputdir1 -v 
         The above command will create a domain on pv and also a domain.yaml file in outputdir1/weblogic-domain/domainname
   3. Check the domain.yaml to make sure there is no FIX ME. If there are any FIX ME's it has to be fixed before proceeding 
         to the next step.
   4. kubectl apply -f domain.yaml
